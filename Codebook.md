## Getting and Cleaning Data - Peer Graded Assignment
### Script Name: 'run_analysis.R'

## Dataset Information
### Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments 
have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets:

* 70% as training data; and
* 30% as test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has 
gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and 
gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff 
frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency 
domain.

## Attribute Information
### Source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


## Identifiers
- Subject Number - The ID number of the test subject (1-30)
- Activities - The types of activities performed when the measurements were taken (1-6)

## Activity Labels
- 1 Walking: walking during the measurement
- 2 Walking_Up: walking up stairs during the measurement
- 3 Walking_Down: walking down stairs during the measurement
- 4 Sitting: sitting during the measurement
- 5 Standing: standing still during the measurement
- 6 Laying: laying down during the measurement


## What the code in 'run_analysis.R' will do (in order) when the script is run:
- Download UCI HAR Dataset and store file locally
- Unzip locally stored zip file
- Load activity labels
1. Read datafiles: train and test datasets.
2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one tidy data set: subject.
   + Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
3. Read features datafile.
   + Create list of feature names.
4. Combine all datasets into one data called 'data'.
5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   + Allocate the result into the 'subs' object
6. Load dplyr package.
7. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
   + Merge both datasets and bring activity names.
8. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
9. From the resulting data set in step 8, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Final Data Set
- ind_tidy_data: a dataset where each unique Identifier is a variable and each row is the set of averages of each variable for each activity 
and each subject
